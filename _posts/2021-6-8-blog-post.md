The main purpose of this writing is to question whether Benford's Law has implications for what it means to be human. Our autonomy is what sets us human beings apart from other animals. We may also attribute our dominance as a species to our autonomy. Are we autonomous? I think you will agree with me that we feel autonomous. Maybe it's not about autonomy at all. The implications of Benford's law may be that our species is not most dominant because of autonomy but because we can lie, cheat, be deceitful. When we go against what is easiest/most authentic we break Benford's law. This is how it is used to detect fraud. Benford's law says that in a random set of data (Snapchat followers, distance traveled by airplane, dollar amounts on tax forms) 30% of the data will begin with the number 1, 17% will begin with the number 2, and so on as a logarithmic function. As alterations on a digital image increase so does the amount removed from Benford's law. So, the more fake something is the less it follows Benford's law. So, maybe we go back to human autonomy and redefine it as the ability to fake. We follow a pattern as a species which doesn’t seem autonomous, but we can deviate from the pattern by being fake. 

 Sidenote:
 sidenote: could I make the case that if we were autonomous these would have no pattern but would be random. Is that true? 

 sidenote: are numbers a made-up social construct? If so, maybe this pattern doesn’t have any philosophical implications.? 

 Could this prove/disprove religion? 

 Any implications for the simulation theory?
