AGU seemed so expansive and overwhelming at first, you really do need to create an itinerary if you're going to catch something specific to your research. I found in the second week that watching AGU TV with a cup of coffee was not only a great way to wake up in the morning but also a helpful tool for navigating the conference. From Town Halls to Braindates, I had the ability to engage with scientists and enthusiasts from around the world. As AGU Fall meeting comes to a close I think we are all left asking the same question. Why did it have to end so soon? Can't wait for the next one!
