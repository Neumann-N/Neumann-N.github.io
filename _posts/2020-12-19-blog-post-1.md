AGU was seemed so expansive and overwelling at first, you really do need to create a itenerary if your going to catch something specfic to your research. I found in the second week that watching AGU TV with a cup of coffee was not only a great way to wake up in the morning but also, a helpful tool for navagating the conference. From Town Halls to Braindates, I had the ability to engage with scientists and enthusists from around the world. As AGU Fall meeting comes to a close I think we are all left asking the same question. Why did it have to end so soon? Cant wait for the next one!
