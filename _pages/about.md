**Research Associate** at <a href="https://lamont.columbia.edu/" style="color: black;">Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory</a>   
I am currently working with <a href="https://crew.ldeo.columbia.edu/people/robert-pincus" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">Robert Pincus</a> and <a href="https://www.teampaccc.mit.edu/" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">Arlene Fiore</a> on an idealized global modeling framework for understanding relationships between cloud albedo and atmospheric composition.  

**About Me**  
I graduated with my B.S. in Physics from Minnesota State University Mankato, where I had to find earth science research elsewhere. I found Nick Lutsko at UCSD, and we research midlatitude near-surface synoptic temperature variability. I continued to pick up research projects and have worked extensively with professors at UCLA and UCSB.  I took earth science graduate classes at CU Boulder as a continuing education student after obtaining my B.S. I'm now working at Lamont  on idealized modeling with the CESM aquaplanet.
