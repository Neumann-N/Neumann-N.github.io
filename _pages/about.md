**Graduate Student & Research Assistant** at <a href="https://artsci.tamu.edu/oceanography/index.html" style="color: black;">Texas A&M University</a>   
I am currently working with <a href="https://artsci.tamu.edu/oceanography/contact/profiles/spencer-jones.html" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">Dr. Spencer Jones</a> on researching the strength and effects of isopycnal mixing.

**About Me**  
I graduated with my B.S. in Physics from Minnesota State University Mankato, where I had to find earth science research elsewhere. I found <a href="https://nicklutsko.github.io/" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">Nicholas Lutsko</a> at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and we investigated midlatitude near-surface synoptic temperature variability. I continued to pick up research projects and have worked extensively with professors at UCLA, UCSB, and TAMU.  I also took earth science graduate classes at CU Boulder as a continuing education student after obtaining my B.S. I'm now an Oceanography graduate student at TAMU.
