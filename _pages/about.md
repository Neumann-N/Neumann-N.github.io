### Research Associate  
   
[Columbia's Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory](https://lamont.columbia.edu/)  
I am currently working with [Robert Pincus](https://crew.ldeo.columbia.edu/people/robert-pincus) and [Arlene Fiore](https://www.teampaccc.mit.edu/our-team) on an idealized global modeling framework for understanding relationships between cloud albedo and atmospheric composition.
