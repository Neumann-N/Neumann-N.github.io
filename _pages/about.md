I am a physics post-baccalaureate researcher studying various climate topics. In my climate endeavors and alongside various professors I've had the chance to create a two-layer model of the ACC to research AABW export, to use an idealized aquaplanet model to study daily temperature variability and skewness at mid-latitudes, and to derive/decompose simplified radiative transfer equations in the stratosphere to study the effects of halocarbons on our warming planet and on the ozone layer. I am looking to begin graduate studies in atmospheric and oceanic sciences in the Fall of 2022. My favorite part about climate science is the real-world impact that comes with understanding our current state and predict the changes to come.
