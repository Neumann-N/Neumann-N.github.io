I am a physics post-baccalaureate researcher studying various climate topics. In my climate endeavors, I have used an idealized aquaplanet model to study daily near-surface temperature variability and skewness at mid-latitudes. I've also created a two-layer simulation of the ACC to research both AABW export and eddy saturation via standing waves. Most recently, I derived simplified radiative transfer equations in the stratosphere to study the warming effect of halocarbons and other optically thin compounds on our planet. I am looking to begin graduate studies in atmospheric and oceanic sciences in the Fall of 2022. My favorite part about climate science is the real-world impact that comes with understanding our current state, how we got to it, and predicting the changes to come.
