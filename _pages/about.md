I am a physics post-baccalaureate passionate about engaging in Earth Science research and contributing to the fight against climate change. To better equip me for this fight, I am taking classes as a non-degree seeking graduate student in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences department at CU Boulder. In addition, for the Fall of 2022, I have applied to become a degree-seeking graduate student at various universities.
