The Pacific Walker circulation alters weather and climate extremes around the world but its sensitivity to climate forcings remains unknown. Understanding the mechanisms underlying Walker circulation variability and trends from the Last Millennium through the 20th century, and the relative roles of external forcings and internal variability are what drives this research. We are employing statistical analysis, such as linear regression, on the CESM Last Millenium Ensemble data.
