In preparation for this research, I have studied available literature on the topic. We are now working to develop a mathematical theory for the response of Antarctic bottom water fluctuations to changing wind and buoyancy forcing. Once the theory has been developed, we intend to use a model to test it. The model we will use, created by Dr. Stewart, is AWSIM.
