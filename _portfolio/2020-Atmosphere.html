title: "The Influence of Continental Geometry and Land Surface Properties on Temperature Variability"

I am currently working on this project with Dr. Nick Lutsko from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography. We are using the idealized ISCA model to explore how continental geometry and land surface properties affect temperature variability. We have run simulations in which the shape of the continent is varied, but “land” is defined as an ocean surface with a shallow depth. Right now, we are analyzing and interpreting the simulations and next we will examine how adding an idealized land surface model affects these results. In January of 2021 I presented this research in lightning talk format at APS CUWiP.
