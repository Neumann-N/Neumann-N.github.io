The highest tempurature variability on Earth is over North America, with twice as much variance in daily-mean temperatures as Eurasia. We are using the idealized ISCA model to explore how continental geometry and land surface properties affect this temperature variability. We have run simulations in which the shape of the continent is varied, but “land” is defined as an ocean surface with a shallow depth. Right now, we are analyzing and interpreting the simulations and next we will examine how adding an idealized land surface model affects these results. In January of 2021, I presented this research in lightning talk format at APS CUWiP.
